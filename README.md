# Travel Planner Project

## Description

This project is an application for recording and managing travel itineraries. 
The program will include an arbitrary number of travel entries, each with a name that specifies the content 
of each trip. Within each trip entry, further and more detailed information will be given. Some examples of these 
possible sections included in each
trip are:
- pricing
- flight information
- hotel details
- activities
- packing lists

## Audience and Reasoning

The primary target audience for this project is frequent travelers. 
The program will give them a space to keep all information regarding future, current, and 
past trips in one place in an organized fashion. This is highly beneficial for people who go 
on multiple trips a year, whether that be for business or pleasure, as it is quite easy to
lose track of the details mentioned above. This topic is of personal interest to me as I love 
traveling and am fortunate enough to get to enjoy vacationing often. And as previously stated,
it is really easy to lose track of important information unless it is kept in a single location
that is easily assessable. Therefore, I want to use this project as a way to make traveling 
more convenient and prevent logistical problems from occurring.
